The ARIA Authoring Practices has a section on drag and drop, 
which outlines the attributes we’ll need, and has guidelines on how the 
interactions should work. To summarize:

1   Draggable elements are identified with aria-grabbed="false", 
    and must be navigable with the keyboard.
2   Provide a mechanism for the user to select which elements they want to drag, 
    and the recommended keystroke is Space. When an element is selected for dragging, 
    its aria-grabbed attribute is set to "true".
3   Provide a mechanism for the user to indicate that they’ve finished making selections, 
    and the recommended keystroke is Control+M.
4   Target elements are then identified with aria-dropeffect, 
    with a value that indicates which actions are allowed, such as "move" or "copy". 
    At this point in the process, target elements must also be navigable with the keyboard.
5   When the user arrives at a target element, provide a mechanism for them to perform 
    the drop action, and the recommended keystroke is also Control+M.
6   Users can cancel the entire operation at any time, by pressing the Escape key.
7   When the action is completed or aborted, clean-up the interface by setting all 
    aria-dropeffect attributes to "none" (or removing them), and all aria-grabbed 
    attributes to "false".
